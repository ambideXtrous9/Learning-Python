    "To solve this problem, we can follow the idea of \"peeling an onion\" from the outside layer. The basic idea is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize Leaves: Start by identifying all the leaves of the tree (nodes with only one edge).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Peel the Onion: Remove the current leaves, reduce the degree of each affected node (node which was connected to a removed leaf), and then determine the new leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Repeat: Continue this process until we're left with one or two nodes, which will be our answer since a tree of n nodes has at most 2 MHTs."
